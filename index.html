    <div class="about">
      <p>My name is Ashley Jones. I am a recent graduate of Spelman College, where I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.<br>
        In my spare time, I love spending time with friends, watching movies, drawing, and dancing. Chocolate is the love of my life, and if you supply me with chocolate - <br>
        you might just be deemed my best friend. My dream vacation would be to Greece, and though I am East Coast born and raised, I have the spirit of the San Francisco Bay Area.<br>

            <p>Art has always been my first love (even before chocolate). I love to draw in pencil and charcoal, but would love to branch out into painting. Click the picture above to see some of my latest work!</p>

            <p>I feel that no one can just be summed up in words, so feel free to take a deeper look into who I really am! Here are some of my favorite pictures</p>

            <img src="images/text_editor.png" alt="Terminal" class="img-responsive"/>
            <p>As well as having a love for art, I have equally had a love for math and critical thinking. For this reason, Mathematics was my favorite subject in elementary school and when I went to college,<br>
            I decided to try out Computer Science. I fell in love after my first programming class and never looked back since! Take some time to click on the terminal above and check out my latest projects!</p>
